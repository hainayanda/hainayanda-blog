          Everything started even before I'm going to college. It started in my high school period. 
          Started when I try and learn by myself to exploit some open source bot for online games until I decided to seriously learn about programming.

          My curiousity started from the question about "how can some electrical device can perform such a thing just by a bunch of code?". 
          This curiousity lead me to Computer Engineering Major. Later this curiousity became passion in programming, in like all type of software development.
